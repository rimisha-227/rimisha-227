<h2><b>Wanna know about html?</b><i>(For Beginners!hehe!)</i></h2>
<br>
<p><b>HTML stands for hypertext markup language. It is a complete code package that allows the user
to create web pages that contain both text and graphics. It is a simple markup launguage that
describes the structure and behaviour of  the web document. all the web browsers are designed
to understand and intrepret this language.</b></p>
<br>
<i><b>Let us analyse the acronym of HTML</b></i>
<br>
<h3><b>Hypertext</b></h3>
<p>hypertext is a piece of ordinary text that has been spruced up with a special feature of linking
to other documents or webpages. So, when you click on the hypertext , it opens a new web page.</p>
<br>
<h3><b>Markup Language</b></h3>
<p>it is a language that uses special symbols called 'TAGS' to mark up a text document that instructs
the browser how to display the text. markup language are solely concerned with classifying the parts
of a document according to their funtions like, indicating wihch part is the title of the document,
which part is heading or subheading, and so on.<br>
originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents to facilitate
the sharing of scientific informations between researches. now, it is being widely used to format
web pages with th ehelp of different tags.</p>

<h2><b>Brief History of HTML</b></h2><br>
<p>HTML started its journey in the 1969 with General Markup Language(GML). In 1986,this language was
modified and standardised and named Standard General Markup Language(SGML). In 1989, Tim Berners Lee and
his team re-designed this language and named it as HTML. The standard version of it came into existence in
1995, when HTML 2.0 version was announced. Lated on, after two years, in 1997, HTML 3.0 and then again after two
years, in 1999, HTML 4.0 was announced. HTML5 came into existence around 2008. The two major organisations that were involved in 
developing HTML5 were World Wide Web Consortium(W3C) and Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group 
(WHATWG).</p><br>
<p><b>HTML5 is the latest version of HTML. It is a markup language using which you can create a web page in an
easy and convenient way. Now, adding audio and videon clips in the web pade is as easy as including images,
which was not possible in the earlier versions without the support of external software or plug-ins flash payer.
With the canvas feature, you can also draw images directly in the web page. All these attributes of this new 
version have added revelance and credibility to it.</b></p><br>
